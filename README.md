## 📌 Case Overview  
We tackled a real-world supply chain crisis for **Grand Canyon Infrastructure (GCI)**, a fictional data center hardware company facing severe component shortages, tariff hikes, and unmet demand for its flagship product — the **Saguaro Rack**.

**Challenge**:  
Design a supply chain strategy that minimizes risk, maintains customer loyalty, and navigates capacity constraints and geopolitical disruptions.

---

## 🔍 Key Problem Areas  
- Critical dependency on a single supplier in Taiwan  
- Component lead times ballooning from 4 to 12 weeks  
- 15% tariffs on key inputs affecting US and EMEA operations  
- Contract manufacturer capacity limits and logistics delays  
- Rising demand outpacing fixed supply (850 → 1150 racks/month)

---

## 💡 Our Strategy

### 1. **Proportional Regional Allocation**
- Dynamic supply allocation model based on real-time regional demand and margin optimization  
- Priority given to high-value customers and markets  

### 2. **Logistics Optimization**
- Air freight for urgent orders, ocean freight for stable demand  
- Inventory staging near CMs, customs pre-clearance to reduce latency  

### 3. **Risk Mitigation**
- Shift from single-source to 70:30 dual sourcing  
- Supplier development + modular redesign of components  
- Geo-diversification: China+1 strategy with friend-shoring (India, Vietnam)

### 4. **Tariff Engineering**
- Use of FTZs (Foreign Trade Zones) to reduce duty impact  
- Re-exports, BOM restructuring, and HTS code optimization

---

## 📊 Impact Summary  
- Prevented $600,000 annual tariff costs through FTZ use  
- Recovered $100,000/month in revenue via buffer stock  
- Maintained >95% fill rate through transparency and empathy-based communication  
- Built long-term supply resilience without sacrificing delivery timelines
